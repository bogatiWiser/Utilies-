// Welcome to the TypeScript Playground, this is a website
// which gives you a chance to write, share and learn TypeScript.

// You could think of it in three ways:
//
//  - A location to learn TypeScript where nothing can break
//  - A place to experiment with TypeScript syntax, and share the URLs with others
//  - A sandbox to experiment with different compiler features of TypeScript

const anExampleVariable = "Hello World"
console.log(anExampleVariable)
let results: string[]
//results = [1]
results =  ['1','1','1','9','5']
function temp1(){
    if (results.includes('1')){
        throw new Error("the length of the results is 0")
    }

}
function temp2(){

try{
    results = results.map((data) => {temp1() ; return (data+1)})
    }catch{
      console.log("error")
      
    }
    console.log(results)
}
temp2()
